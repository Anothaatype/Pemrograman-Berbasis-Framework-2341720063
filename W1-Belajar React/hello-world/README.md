## Practicum 1 — Setting Up Development Environment

### Question 1

**Explain the function of Git, VS Code, and Node.js**

From my understanding after installing and using these tools, Git is a version control system that helps me track changes in my code and manage different versions of a project. It is useful for maintaining history and collaboration. Visual Studio Code is a code editor that I use to write and manage my code. It provides useful features such as extensions, debugging tools, and terminal integration which make development more efficient. Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser. It is essential because React and Next.js require Node.js to run the development server and manage dependencies.

### Question 2

**Provide proof that the tools have been successfully installed**

I have successfully installed Git, VS Code, and Node.js on my device. The proof is shown through screenshots of Git version, Node.js version, and the VS Code interface which indicate that each tool is properly installed and ready to use.

## Practicum 2 — Creating First React Project using Next.js

### Question 1

**Explain the following terms: TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, App Router, Import Alias, and Turbopack**

Based on what I learned during the setup process:

- **TypeScript** is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to help reduce errors and improve code quality.
- **ESLint** is a tool that analyzes code to maintain consistency and detect potential issues.
- **Tailwind CSS** is a utility-first CSS framework that allows me to design user interfaces quickly using predefined classes.
- **App Router** is a routing system in Next.js that manages navigation using a folder-based structure.
- **Import Alias** is used to simplify file paths so the code becomes cleaner and easier to read.
- **Turbopack** is a fast bundler that improves development performance, especially during build and refresh processes.

### Question 2

**Explain the function of folders and files in the React project structure**

From the project structure that I observed:

| File / Folder | Function |
|---|---|
| `app/` | Contains the main pages and routing system of the application |
| `public/` | Stores static files such as images and icons |
| `styles/` | Used to manage global styling |
| `package.json` | Manages dependencies and project scripts |
| `next.config.js` | Used for configuring the Next.js application |
| `node_modules/` | Contains all installed libraries required for the project to run |

### Question 3

**Provide proof that the steps have been successfully completed**

I have successfully created and run a Next.js project. The proof is shown through screenshots of the project structure in VS Code and the application running in the browser using localhost.

## Practicum 3 — Adding React Component Button

### Question 1

**Provide proof that the steps have been successfully completed**

I have successfully created a Button component and displayed it in the application. From this step, I learned that React components help make the user interface modular and reusable. This makes development more organized and scalable. The proof is shown through screenshots of the component code and the result displayed in the browser.

## Practicum 4 — Writing Markup with JSX

### Question 1

**What is the use of the syntax `user.imageUrl`?**

From my understanding, the syntax `user.imageUrl` is used to access a specific property from an object — in this case, the image URL from a user object. In JSX, this allows dynamic data rendering so that the displayed content can change based on the data provided.

### Question 2

**Provide proof that the steps have been successfully completed**

I have successfully implemented JSX to display dynamic data in the application. The proof is shown through screenshots of the JSX code and the output in the browser.

## Conclusion

From this practicum, I learned how to set up a development environment, create a React project using Next.js, understand the project structure, build reusable components, and use JSX for dynamic rendering. This practicum helped me understand the fundamental concepts of modern web development.
